A [CheckIt](https://checkit.clontz.org) bank.

## warning!

I wrote this to teach my Spring 2022 course using an in-development version of CheckIt 0.2. As such, it does not currently work on any published version of CheckIt. I also have some pedagogical considerations I want to make in the process of an update, so for now consider this repository AS-IS. It's possible you can copy-paste some generators into a fresh CheckIt 0.2 bank; as of 2022-07-22 the templates are in an outdated syntax and need to be rebuilt using SpaTeXt 0.2: https://github.com/StevenClontz/checkit/wiki/SpaTeXt-templates
